                    <h1>Getting Started with Cloud IAM</h1>
                </div>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    <strong>Google Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management)</strong> is a security tool that controls who can access 
                    what within Google Cloud resources. It enables organizations to manage permissions centrally, 
                    ensuring that the right people have the right level of access.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Instead of using separate credentials for each service, IAM provides a **unified authentication system** 
                    with **role-based access control (RBAC)** for managing permissions across Google Cloud.
                </p>

                <h2>Key Features of Cloud IAM</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> – Uses predefined roles (Viewer, Editor, Owner) and custom roles to grant granular permissions at project, folder, or organization levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fine-Grained Security Policies</strong> – Assign permissions to users, groups, or service accounts, restricting their access to specific services or actions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Layered Authentication</strong> – Supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for extra security and integrates with Google Workspace for seamless access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audit Logging & Compliance</strong> – Provides detailed logs in Cloud Logging to track changes and ensure regulatory compliance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Getting Started with Cloud IAM</h2>

                <h3>Step 1: Granting IAM Roles via Console</h3>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    - Open **Google Cloud Console** and navigate to **IAM & Admin > IAM**.
                    <br>- Select a **project or organization**.
                    <br>- Click **Add Member** and enter the user’s email.
                    <br>- Choose a **role** (e.g., Viewer, Editor, Owner).
                    <br>- Click **Save** to apply the changes.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 2: Assigning IAM Roles via gcloud CLI</h3>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    To grant a role to a user, use:
                </p>
                <pre>
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project \
  --member="user:example@gmail.com" \
  --role="roles/editor"
                </pre>

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    To remove a role:
                </p>
                <pre>
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding my-project \
  --member="user:example@gmail.com" \
  --role="roles/editor"
                </pre>

                <h3>Step 3: Viewing IAM Policies</h3>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Check the current IAM settings using:
                </p>
                <pre>
gcloud projects get-iam-policy my-project
                </pre>

                <h2>Common Use Cases for Cloud IAM</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ **Restricting access** to sensitive cloud resources.</li>
                    <li>✅ **Managing service accounts** for automated workflows.</li>
                    <li>✅ **Enforcing least privilege policies** to improve security.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    <strong>Google Cloud IAM</strong> is essential for managing permissions efficiently. By setting up 
                    **role-based access control**, you can secure your cloud environment while ensuring that 
                    the right users have access to the right resources.
