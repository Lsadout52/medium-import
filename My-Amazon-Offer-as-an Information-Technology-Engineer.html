          <h1>My Amazon Offer as an Information Technology Engineer</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph"><strong>A Second Chance During the First Half of the Pandemic</strong></p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          During the early months of the pandemic, tech giants were hiring massively to meet the surge in digital transformation. Companies needed more cloud engineers, IT professionals, and developers to support growing online operations.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          🙈 See: <a href="#">Rejected by Amazon. Here's What I Learned</a>
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          In early 2020, I was in the USA for some classes but decided to return to France quickly to avoid lockdowns. A few days after arriving, I received a call from Amazon.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          <em>"Hello Mr. Bah, this is Amazon. We have your resume and are hiring for a position in your city."</em>
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Before we even got into the details, they asked:
          <em>“Have you improved your English?”</em>
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          This time, I confidently said, “Absolutely.”  
          The funny thing? I wasn’t expecting the call and wasn’t prepared at all. But I pushed through the one-hour conversation with the recruiter. At the end, they told me:
          <em>“We will contact you if the outcome is positive.”</em>
        </p>

        <h2>The Waiting Game</h2>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          A week passed, then another. I started thinking, “They probably rejected me again but are too busy to send a rejection email.”
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I told my mum about it. She looked at me and said:
          <em>“Why are you being so negative? You’re usually so enthusiastic and positive!”</em>
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          She was right. But I had no expectations anymore.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Then, two weeks later, I suddenly received multiple interview invites. Over the next few weeks, I went through 4-5 rounds of interviews, and this time—three weeks later—I received an offer from Amazon.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          But here’s the twist: It wasn’t for AWS.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Initially Rejected the Offer</h2>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Considering that Amazon had rejected me a few years ago, I wasn’t overly excited this time.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          On top of that, the salary they offered was lower than what I was already making at my current job. So, I politely declined.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I responded to the recruiter, sharing my current contract and explaining my situation. But I didn’t just stop there—I also used this as a chance to sell myself:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “I love Amazon and really want to join (think about my first battery phone issue when I was in Africa, and finally got it from Amazon). If you’re looking for a determined, self-motivated individual who constantly raises the bar, I’m the right person.”
        </blockquote>

        <h2>A Surprise Turnaround</h2>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          A few weeks later, I told my mum again, “This time it’s real. They rejected me.”
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          One of my data scientist friends from Guinea (West Africa) said to me:
          <em>“If they really like your experience and your journey, they’ll come back and give you an opportunity. Companies hire real stories, and man, you have real stories to share.”</em>
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I responded: “No way, man. I don’t think it’s the right moment.”
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Then, out of nowhere, four weeks later, the recruiter updated the offer—this time, matching my exact salary from my current job.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          And they added stock options. 🎉  
          Now, it was different. This time, it was the right moment.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Finally Said Yes</h2>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          By this point, I had gone through Amazon’s loop interviews and had a deep understanding of the company’s culture and leadership principles. I had read countless stories online about Amazon’s high-performance culture and how it fosters innovation.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I knew this was a place where I could grow, learn, and have a real impact.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          So I said yes.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ <strong>Never settle for less.</strong> If you know your worth, don’t be afraid to negotiate.</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>Patience pays off.</strong> Sometimes, companies need time to reevaluate and make better offers.</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>Every rejection can lead to a better opportunity.</strong> If I had joined Amazon two years earlier, I wouldn’t have gotten this better offer with stocks.</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>Selling yourself matters.</strong> Companies are not just hiring skills—they're hiring people with drive, stories, persistence, and confidence.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          <strong>“From being rejected to receiving an offer—I finally made it to Amazon.”</strong>
