          <h1>Rejected by Amazon. Here's What I Learned</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph"><strong>The Call That Changed Everything</strong></p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          In 2016, I moved to Paris from Senegal (West Africa), to pursue my studies and started getting more familiar with technology and cloud computing after growing up in between Guinea and Senegal. At the time, I was taking VMware ESXi classes to prepare for a certification at Global Knowledge Center.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          One day, during class, my phone rang. I decided to pick it up.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          <em>"Hello, this is Amazon recruiter. We’re hiring in Paris for a Cloud Support Engineer role specialized in Windows (French speaker required). We found your profile on LinkedIn and your contact details. Do you have a few minutes to discuss?"</em>
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I was a bit surprised but thought: “Well, isn’t the goal to get hired? Let’s talk.”
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph"><strong>My First Amazon Interview</strong></p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          The recruiter introduced themselves, explaining that they were based in Dublin, Ireland, and gave me the usual background about Amazon vs. AWS. After a brief chat, we quickly moved to technical questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Active Directory</li>
          <li>✅ DNS Services</li>
          <li>✅ Networking Basics</li>
          <li>✅ Windows Server Management</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I managed to answer everything correctly. I was feeling confident. Then, they shifted to behavioral questions—and that’s when things changed.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Since we were speaking in English, I started struggling:  
          <em>“Huh... ah... so...”</em>  
          I wasn’t fluent enough, and it became obvious.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          The recruiter stopped me and tried to move the discussion back to explaining the difference between Amazon and AWS, giving me another chance to relax. We had a great conversation, but by the end, they told me:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “We really like your profile. However, even though this position is based in Paris, you need to speak English fluently. We won’t be able to continue this time, but work on your English—we may recontact you in a few years.”
        </blockquote>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          That rejection hurt. It was my first real job interview, and I wasn’t prepared to hear ‘no’ just because of a language barrier.
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph"><strong>Learning from Failure</strong></p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          After the call ended, I missed an hour of class, trying to process everything. I started discussing with a fellow student—someone from Senegal, who was taking the same VMware course and working for Orange (a telecom company).
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I told him about my Amazon interview experience and how my English had let me down.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          His response? “Man, Amazon! That’s a huge opportunity. I know we’re not native speakers, but you need to start practicing. Try Duolingo.”
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          That same day, I downloaded Duolingo and started learning. 📱  
          I later found AJ Hoge, a well-known English learning coach, and started practicing with YouTube videos, podcasts, and live conversations.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>✔️ <strong>Failure is not the end</strong>—it’s a lesson. That rejection motivated me to improve my English.</li>
          <li>✔️ <strong>Always be prepared</strong>. You don’t know when an opportunity will come.</li>
          <li>✔️ <strong>Language barriers can be overcome</strong>. Practice, immersion, and persistence are key.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          <strong>“It’s better to be prepared and not have an opportunity than to have an opportunity and not be prepared.”</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          <em>“I didn’t make it this time, but I’ll be back.”</em> (like the Terminator 🤖😄)
