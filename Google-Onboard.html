                    <strong>Fresh Out of My First Google Cloud Platform Event</strong>
                </p>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Just a few days ago, on March 21, 2018, I attended my first-ever Google Cloud event in Paris: Cloud OnBoard. To be honest, I wasn’t planning to go.
                </p>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    As a Microsoft Consultant specializing in Office 365, I was working for a French automotive parts manufacturer with operations across Europe and Asia. They had just acquired a U.S.-based company in Europe, which was running on Google G Suite.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    My job? Migrate 1,500 G Suite users to M365.
                </p>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Problem? I had almost zero experience with Google’s ecosystem, aside from my personal use of Google Suite (which I had been using since 2011, when I was 13).
                </p>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    One of my stakeholders in that acquired company suggested I attend a Google Cloud learning event in Paris. At first, I wasn’t interested—I was deeply focused on Microsoft technologies, especially MS Teams at that time. But eventually, I signed up and planned to leave the event around 2 PM.

                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    That event ended up changing my entire journey.
                </p>
                
                <h2>The Event That Changed Everything</h2>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The event took place in Paris on March 21, 2018, about six months ago, with around 600 attendees. We had speakers like Didier Girard from SFEIR, alongside other Google Cloud professionals.
                </p>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    It was a full day of sessions—80+ slides, live demos, and deep dives into Google Cloud technologies. While I had originally come for G Suite insights, I was surprised to find that the focus was heavily on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
                </p>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    At first, I wasn’t sure how this related to my work. But after talking with Google Cloud experts, they introduced me to Coursera, where I could learn more about G Suite. This was my first real exposure to Google Cloud’s computing power and how businesses were leveraging it. This helped me to structure my migration into batches of user groups (starting with 30 per migration, then moving 50, then 70, and so on).
                </p>
                
                <h2>What I Learned About GCP</h2>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    At the event, I discovered that Google Cloud was much more than just infrastructure. It wasn’t just about machines and operating systems—it also included:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Databases & development environments for the most widely used programming languages.</li>
                    <li>AI & machine learning tools, like real-time translation and image recognition.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    I realized that Google Cloud was growing rapidly and that these technologies would soon become essential for businesses. That event pushed me to explore Google Cloud further, and it became a key part of my journey into cloud technologies.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Looking back, what started as a one-time event to help with a migration project turned into a turning point in my career. That day in Paris made me realize the power of Google Cloud and how much it was shaping the future of technology.
                </p>
                
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    It’s funny how a single decision—attending an event I almost skipped—completely changed my perspective.
                </p>
