        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          By 2024, I had built a software tool that went viral internally at Amazon. Engineers across different teams started testing it,
          and some even suggested submitting it for a security review to expand its reach beyond France to Europe.
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          One day, an engineer from Sunnyvale, USA, reached out and said:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “We’ve been trying to build something like this for years with little success. Would you be open to making this an official product?”
        </blockquote>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          It felt like an acquisition of my idea to be moved to the USA, since important decisions came from the headquarters, right? 😄
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          My manager was extremely supportive and encouraged me to present my work to a larger audience.
          Most of this development happened during my free time—outside billable work hours. I was simply building because that’s what I do.
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I don’t usually like attending in-person global meetings and prefer remote participation. But in November 2024,
          my manager insisted I attend our annual leadership meeting in Paris.
        </p>

        <h2>🏆 Winning the Just Do It Award</h2>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          At the meeting, the time came for recognizing employees who had made significant contributions. 
          The venue was a packed 900-person theater in Paris.
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Suddenly, our Vice President, <strong>Russell Grandinetti</strong>, stepped on stage and announced:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “Our ‘Just Do It Award’ recognizes employees who exemplify two of our core values: Innovation and Bias for Action.”
        </blockquote>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Then he continued:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “This year’s winner has developed a tool that is revolutionizing our laptop migration process. The solution streamlines
          Windows laptop migrations for Amazon and AWS users, reducing the process to just 2 hours. It is fully cloud-integrated
          and entirely customizable.”
        </blockquote>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          <strong>“The Just Do It Award goes to… Sadou Bah!”</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          💥 I was in shock. My imposter syndrome kicked in. How did I, a kid from Dakar who didn’t even know about Amazon 10 years ago,
          win one of the most prestigious internal awards?
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I walked onto the stage, completely overwhelmed. I barely remember what I said. But after the event,
          I found myself in the restroom, and I just started crying.
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          It hit me—I had been working tirelessly for years, building tools (many of which failed), persuading Amazon decision-makers,
          and pushing solutions globally. And now, I was being recognized at the highest level.
        </p>

        <h2>🌍 Final Thoughts: From Dakar to Amazon’s Global Impact</h2>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Looking back, I never imagined I would end up here. From trying to buy a phone battery on Amazon without even knowing what Amazon was,
          to receiving an award from its global leadership, my journey has been anything but ordinary.
        </p>

        <h2>🚀 Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Every rejection is a lesson – My first AWS interview rejection made me focus on improving my English, which later paid off.</li>
          <li>✅ Be open to new opportunities – Even if it’s not your first choice, entering Amazon opened doors for me to reach AWS.</li>
          <li>✅ Keep building – Many of my tools failed, but the one that succeeded changed everything.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          If someone had told my 17-year-old self in Senegal that this would be my future, I wouldn’t have believed them. But here we are.
