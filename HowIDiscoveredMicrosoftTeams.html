          <h1>Azure Days: How I Discovered Microsoft Teams</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          <strong>First Real Project, First Real Teams Experience</strong><br />
          After my studies, I joined a consulting firm as a Microsoft Consultant, and one of my first big missions was working on a large infrastructure migration—from on-premises Exchange to Office 365 for a global manufacturing client.
          <br />➡️ No server relocation. Everything would move to the cloud.
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I had been deeply focused on Azure AD, Exchange Online, and ADFS integration—handling over hundreds of user accounts—so when the roadmap mentioned Microsoft Teams, I thought:<br />
          <em>"Wait, is this the Skype replacement everyone’s talking about?"</em><br />
          I had heard of Teams, but I hadn’t used it beyond basic messaging. Now I had to plan a real deployment for hundreds of users—and fast.
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          <strong>Enter: Microsoft Azure Days – Issy-les-Moulineaux</strong><br />
          Around the same time, our consulting firm was regularly invited to sessions with Microsoft technical teams—usually remote. But this time, it was a full hands-on event held at Microsoft’s offices in Issy-les-Moulineaux, France. I figured it could help me better understand some Azure integrations, but I wasn’t expecting what came next.
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Live demos, architecture best practices, integration with Exchange and SharePoint, governance policies—everything I needed for my project.<br />
          The Microsoft engineers didn’t just present slides—they opened live tenants, showed Teams Admin Center, explained rollout strategies, and even gave us access to sandbox environments.
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          <em>The session gave me clarity I didn’t know I needed:</em>
          <ul>
            <li>How to plan a phased rollout</li>
            <li>How to configure Teams policies by user group</li>
            <li>How to manage permissions and data lifecycle</li>
            <li>How to train and onboard non-technical users</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Back at the client site, I designed a POC rollout to just a few users, then gradually extended the deployment. For many users, it was their first exposure to cloud collaboration, and for me—it was my first time seeing the value of Teams beyond messaging.
        </p>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          <strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
          That Microsoft Azure Days event helped me go from "just migrating mailboxes" to leading a modern workplace transformation. It taught me that Teams isn’t just a tool—it’s a shift in how people work, communicate, and share across borders and departments.

          <strong>Key Takeaways from My First Microsoft Teams Project</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Don’t underestimate what you haven’t used yet—Teams looked simple but had so much under the hood.</li>
            <li>✅ Events can be a fast-track to understanding complex tools.</li>
            <li>✅ Hands-on labs > docs sometimes—seeing is believing.</li>
            <li>✅ Teams is not Skype—it’s a full platform for work collaboration, not just video calls.</li>
