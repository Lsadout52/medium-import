          <h1>My Journey from Africa to Amazon as a Cloud Architect</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph"><strong>How It All Started: My First Online Purchase</strong></p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Back in high school in 2014, I was in Dakar, Senegal, and my phone—a Samsung 3600i—had a completely dead battery.
          There were no official repair agencies or maintenance points to order a replacement part. I started searching online and
          eventually landed on a website called <strong>Amazon.fr</strong>. There, I found the battery I needed for 12 euros—the only problem?
          No delivery option to Africa.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          To make things more complicated, I had no money to purchase it either. After discussing with several family members in France,
          one of them offered me their debit card and told me to go ahead and place the order for them.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Hey Sadou, I’m in France, and I’ve never heard of this ‘Amazon,’ but I trust you. Here’s my debit card and address—please do it for me."
        </blockquote>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          I slowly followed the steps on Amazon.fr, placed the order, and two weeks later, I received a confirmation: 
          <em>“Your package has arrived.”</em> My relative carried it for me on their next trip. It felt like magic—the first online purchase 
          of my life, at age 17.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Of course, I had to wait a few months without a phone. 😅
        </p>

        <h2>From Senegal to Paris: My First Encounter with Amazon</h2>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Fast forward, I moved to Paris in 2016 for my studies and started getting more familiar with technology and cloud computing.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          That same year, I noticed <strong>AWS (Amazon Web Services)</strong> was hiring in Paris. A recruiter reached out to explain 
          the difference between Amazon and AWS, and we had a great discussion. However, at the end of the phone interview, they said:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “We really like your profile. However, even though this position is based in Paris, you need to speak English fluently.
          We won’t be able to continue this time, but work on your English—we may recontact you in a few years.”
        </blockquote>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          That rejection hurt. It was my first real job interview, and I wasn’t prepared to hear <em>no</em> just because of a language barrier.
        </p>

        <h2>Amazon Days: A New Opportunity in 2020</h2>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          In early 2020, during the pandemic, I was in the USA for some classes but decided to return to France quickly to avoid lockdowns.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          A few days after arriving back, Amazon called me again.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “Hello Mr. Bah, this is Amazon. We have your resume and are hiring for a position in your city.”
        </blockquote>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Before starting the interview, they asked:
          <em>“Have you improved your English?”</em>
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          This time, I confidently said “Absolutely.” The funny thing? I wasn’t expecting the call and wasn’t even prepared. But I continued 
          through 1 hour and 2 weeks after, I went through 4–5 rounds of interviews, and this time, I received an offer from Amazon—not AWS.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          At first, I thought this wasn’t what I wanted, but then I realized: inside Amazon, you can impact multiple subsidiaries. 
          Later, I was able to move internally to AWS, fulfilling my original goal.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          From ordering a phone battery on Amazon.fr as a teenager in Dakar to building internal cloud tools as a Cloud Architect 
          at AWS—this journey has been surreal.
        </p>
        <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
          Sometimes, all it takes is one opportunity, one moment, one call… and everything changes.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Small beginnings can lead to extraordinary outcomes.</li>
          <li>✅ Rejection isn’t the end—sometimes, it’s just redirection.</li>
          <li>✅ Innovation and persistence pay off, especially in environments like Amazon.</li>
        </ul>

          “A decade ago, I didn’t even know what Amazon was. Today, I’m shaping its future.” 🚀
