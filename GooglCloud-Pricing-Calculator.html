                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    The <strong>Google Cloud Pricing Calculator</strong> is a web-based tool that allows users to estimate 
                    the cost of using various Google Cloud services. It provides detailed pricing breakdowns for 
                    <strong>Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Kubernetes Engine</strong>, and many more.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
                    Instead of manually calculating cloud costs, the Pricing Calculator simplifies budgeting by 
                    offering <strong>real-time estimates</strong> based on selected usage configurations.
                </p>

                <h2>Key Features</h2>
                <ul>
